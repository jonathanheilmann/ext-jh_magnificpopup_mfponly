.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds a simple checkbox to FAL images added to EXT:news articles to display an image only in the Magnific Popup lighbox, but not in detail view.
This may be helpful if you add many images to an EXT:news article but don't want to display them all in detail view.

Actually only EXT:news is supported.
